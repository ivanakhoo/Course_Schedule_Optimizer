# Course_Schedule_Optimizer
## TODO
- Take in specific course conflict groups as a constraint (realistic)
- Expand time and day slots to as many as we can (realistic)
- Read in course schedule excel file courses into Gurobi matrix (realistic)
- Figure out a way to create preferences for faculty (harder)

## Potential Final Honors Thesis Model
- Read in a course schedule excel file into Gurobi, making switches for the given course conflict groups
