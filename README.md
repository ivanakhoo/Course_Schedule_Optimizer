# Course Schedule Conflict Flagger and Optimizer

## Overview

The Course Schedule Optimizer is a Python-based tool paired with Gurobi Optimizer, designed to streamline and enhance the course scheduling process for Berry Collegeâ€™s School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS). This application helps faculty and academic advisors detect scheduling conflicts and provides recommendations to optimize course arrangements, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors.

## Key Features

- **Recommendation Engine with Gurobi Optimizer**: Using Gurobi Optimizer in Python, this program suggests course rearrangements to resolve identified conflicts. This model serves as a proof of concept for creating an efficient, conflict-free schedule with minimal manual adjustments.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for handling and manipulating Excel-based schedules
  - `gurobipy` for implementing optimization algorithms with Gurobi

## Future Expansion

The project envisions a fully integrated scheduling solution that combines conflict detection and optimization, creating a streamlined and standardized process for MNS faculty. By automating and optimizing schedule generation, this tool aims to reduce faculty workload and establish a reliable scheduling framework for the future.
